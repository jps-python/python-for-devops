### Introduction to Operators in Python

In Python, **operators** are symbols or keywords that perform operations on variables and values. They are used to manipulate data and variables, such as performing mathematical calculations, making logical comparisons, or modifying variables in various ways.

Python supports several types of operators, which are categorized as follows:

---

### 1. **Arithmetic Operators**
Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `+`      | Addition    | `a + b` |
| `-`      | Subtraction | `a - b` |
| `*`      | Multiplication | `a * b` |
| `/`      | Division    | `a / b` |
| `//`     | Floor Division (returns the quotient without the remainder) | `a // b` |
| `%`      | Modulus (returns the remainder) | `a % b` |
| `**`     | Exponentiation | `a ** b` |

#### Example:
```python
a = 10
b = 3
print(a + b)  # Output: 13
print(a - b)  # Output: 7
print(a * b)  # Output: 30
print(a / b)  # Output: 3.333...
print(a // b) # Output: 3
print(a % b)  # Output: 1
print(a ** b) # Output: 1000
```

### 2. **Comparison (Relational) Operators**
Comparison operators are used to compare two values. These operators return a boolean value (`True` or `False`).

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `==`     | Equal to    | `a == b` |
| `!=`     | Not equal to | `a != b` |
| `>`      | Greater than | `a > b` |
| `<`      | Less than   | `a < b` |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to | `a >= b` |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to | `a <= b` |

#### Example:
```python
a = 10
b = 5
print(a == b)  # Output: False
print(a != b)  # Output: True
print(a > b)   # Output: True
print(a < b)   # Output: False
print(a >= b)  # Output: True
print(a <= b)  # Output: False
```

### 3. **Logical Operators**
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements (used in if, while, and other control flow statements).

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `and`    | Returns `True` if both conditions are `True` | `a > 5 and b < 10` |
| `or`     | Returns `True` if at least one condition is `True` | `a > 5 or b < 10` |
| `not`    | Reverses the result, returns `True` if the condition is `False` | `not a > 5` |

#### Example:
```python
a = 10
b = 5
print(a > 5 and b < 10)  # Output: True
print(a > 15 or b < 10)  # Output: True
print(not a > 5)         # Output: False
```

### 4. **Assignment Operators**
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `=`      | Assign value to a variable | `a = 10` |
| `+=`     | Add and assign | `a += 5`  (equivalent to `a = a + 5`) |
| `-=`     | Subtract and assign | `a -= 3`  (equivalent to `a = a - 3`) |
| `*=`     | Multiply and assign | `a *= 2`  (equivalent to `a = a * 2`) |
| `/=`     | Divide and assign | `a /= 4`  (equivalent to `a = a / 4`) |
| `//=`    | Floor divide and assign | `a //= 3`  (equivalent to `a = a // 3`) |
| `%=`     | Modulus and assign | `a %= 3`  (equivalent to `a = a % 3`) |
| `**=`    | Exponentiate and assign | `a **= 2` (equivalent to `a = a ** 2`) |

#### Example:
```python
a = 10
a += 5  # a = a + 5
print(a)  # Output: 15

a *= 2  # a = a * 2
print(a)  # Output: 30

a //= 4  # a = a // 4
print(a)  # Output: 7
```

---

### 5. **Bitwise Operators**
Bitwise operators work on bits and perform bit-by-bit operations.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `&`      | Bitwise AND | `a & b` |
| `|`      | Bitwise OR | `a | b` |
| `^`      | Bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) | `a ^ b` |
| `~`      | Bitwise NOT (flips all the bits) | `~a` |
| `<<`     | Bitwise left shift | `a << 2` |
| `>>`     | Bitwise right shift | `a >> 2` |

#### Example:
```python
a = 5  # 0101 in binary
b = 3  # 0011 in binary

print(a & b)  # Output: 1 (0001 in binary)
print(a | b)  # Output: 7 (0111 in binary)
print(a ^ b)  # Output: 6 (0110 in binary)
print(~a)     # Output: -6 (flip bits, i.e., 1010)
print(a << 1) # Output: 10 (shift bits left: 1010 in binary)
print(a >> 1) # Output: 2 (shift bits right: 0010 in binary)
```

### 6. **Membership Operators**
Membership operators are used to test whether a value is a member of a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, etc.).

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `in`     | Returns `True` if a value is found in the sequence | `a in list` |
| `not in` | Returns `True` if a value is **not** found in the sequence | `a not in list` |

#### Example:
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print("apple" in fruits)    # Output: True
print("grape" not in fruits) # Output: True
```

---

### 7. **Identity Operators**
Identity operators are used to compare the memory locations of two objects.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `is`     | Returns `True` if two variables refer to the same object | `a is b` |
| `is not` | Returns `True` if two variables refer to different objects | `a is not b` |

#### Example:
```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
c = [1, 2, 3]

print(a is b)      # Output: True (a and b refer to the same object)
print(a is c)      # Output: False (a and c refer to different objects)
print(a is not c)  # Output: True (a and c are not the same object)
```

### Summary of Python Operators

- **Arithmetic Operators**: Used for mathematical operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.)
- **Comparison Operators**: Used for comparing values (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, etc.)
- **Logical Operators**: Used for logical operations (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- **Assignment Operators**: Used for assigning values (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.)
- **Bitwise Operators**: Used for bit-level operations (`&`, `|`, `^`, etc.)
- **Membership Operators**: Used to test membership in a sequence (`in`, `not in`)
- **Identity Operators**: Used to test object identity (`is`, `is not`)

These operators form the core of many tasks in Python, from performing calculations to comparing data, and manipulating data structures.
