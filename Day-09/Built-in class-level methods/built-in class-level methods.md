In Python, **class-level functions** or **class methods** are methods that are bound to the class itself, rather than to instances of the class. These methods typically operate on class variables (also called **class attributes**) and not on instance variables.

Python also provides a built-in way to define class-level functions using the `@classmethod` decorator. In addition, Python provides several built-in methods that can be used at the class level to modify or interact with the class.

Here’s a deeper dive into the **class-level functions** and **in-built class methods**:

### 1. **Class Methods**

A **class method** is a method that operates on the class itself, rather than on individual instances. It can modify class-level variables or call other class methods. Class methods take `cls` (class) as the first argument, similar to how instance methods take `self` (instance).

#### Syntax:
```python
class ClassName:
    @classmethod
    def method(cls):
        pass
```

#### Example:
```python
class Vehicle:
    wheels = 4  # Class variable

    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model  # Instance variable

    @classmethod
    def set_wheels(cls, number_of_wheels):
        cls.wheels = number_of_wheels

# Using the class method to modify class variable
Vehicle.set_wheels(6)
print(Vehicle.wheels)  # Output: 6
```

In the example above:
- `set_wheels` is a class method that modifies the `wheels` class variable.

### 2. **Static Methods**

A **static method** does not operate on the instance or the class itself. It’s simply a method that is bound to the class, but it doesn’t take `self` or `cls` as its first parameter. Static methods are used when a function is related to the class but doesn’t need to access any instance-specific or class-specific data.

#### Syntax:
```python
class ClassName:
    @staticmethod
    def method():
        pass
```

#### Example:
```python
class Math:
    @staticmethod
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

    @staticmethod
    def multiply(a, b):
        return a * b

# Calling static methods
result1 = Math.add(10, 20)
result2 = Math.multiply(10, 20)
print(result1)  # Output: 30
print(result2)  # Output: 200
```

In this example:
- `add` and `multiply` are static methods, and they don't need an instance of the class to be called.

### 3. **In-built Class Methods and Attributes**

Python provides several **built-in class-level methods** that are implicitly part of every class, whether they are explicitly defined or not. Some of these methods are used to define class behavior when interacting with objects, such as comparison, string representation, and others.

#### Common Built-in Class Methods:

1. **`__init__(self)`**: 
   - The constructor method that is automatically called when an object (instance) is created.
   
   ```python
   class Person:
       def __init__(self, name, age):
           self.name = name
           self.age = age

   p1 = Person("Alice", 30)
   ```

2. **`__str__(self)`**: 
   - Defines the string representation of an object, called when using `print()` or `str()`.
   
   ```python
   class Person:
       def __init__(self, name, age):
           self.name = name
           self.age = age

       def __str__(self):
           return f"{self.name}, {self.age}"

   p1 = Person("Alice", 30)
   print(p1)  # Output: Alice, 30
   ```

3. **`__repr__(self)`**:
   - Defines a more formal string representation of an object, used by the `repr()` function and in interactive shells.

   ```python
   class Person:
       def __init__(self, name, age):
           self.name = name
           self.age = age

       def __repr__(self):
           return f"Person('{self.name}', {self.age})"

   p1 = Person("Alice", 30)
   print(repr(p1))  # Output: Person('Alice', 30)
   ```

4. **`__del__(self)`**:
   - The destructor method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed.
   
   ```python
   class Person:
       def __del__(self):
           print(f"Object {self} is being destroyed")

   p1 = Person()
   del p1  # Output: Object <__main__.Person object at 0x...> is being destroyed
   ```

5. **`__call__(self)`**:
   - Allows an instance of a class to be called like a function.

   ```python
   class Greet:
       def __init__(self, name):
           self.name = name

       def __call__(self):
           print(f"Hello, {self.name}!")

   greeting = Greet("Alice")
   greeting()  # Output: Hello, Alice!
   ```

---

### 4. **Class-level Attributes and Methods**

- **Class Attributes** are variables that belong to the class itself and are shared among all instances of that class.
- **Instance Attributes** are variables that belong to a specific instance and are unique to each object.

#### Example:
```python
class Car:
    wheels = 4  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model  # Instance attribute

    @classmethod
    def change_wheels(cls, new_wheels):
        cls.wheels = new_wheels

    def display_model(self):
        print(f"Car model: {self.model}")

# Accessing class-level attribute
print(Car.wheels)  # Output: 4

# Changing class-level attribute using class method
Car.change_wheels(6)
print(Car.wheels)  # Output: 6

# Creating an instance and accessing instance-level attribute
car1 = Car("Sedan")
car1.display_model()  # Output: Car model: Sedan
```

---

### 5. **Important Class-Level Methods for Object Manipulation**

- **`__new__(cls)`**: This method is called before `__init__`. It is responsible for creating a new instance of the class and is rarely used directly.
- **`__init__(self)`**: Called when the object is created (constructor).
- **`__del__(self)`**: Called when an object is about to be destroyed (destructor).
- **`__str__(self)`**: Called when the `str()` function is called on the object (for string representation).
- **`__repr__(self)`**: Called when the `repr()` function is called or in interactive shells.
- **`__call__(self)`**: Allows an object to be called like a function.

### Summary of Class-level Functions and Concepts:
1. **Class Methods** (`@classmethod`): Functions that operate on the class itself, modifying class-level variables.
2. **Static Methods** (`@staticmethod`): Functions that belong to the class but don’t access or modify class or instance-level variables.
3. **Built-in Methods** like `__init__`, `__del__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, and `__call__`, which manage how objects are created, destroyed, and interacted with.
4. **Class-Level Attributes**: Variables shared by all instances of the class.

These concepts and methods provide powerful functionality for creating and manipulating Python classes. By understanding and leveraging these methods, you can create efficient and effective object-oriented designs.
