Mastering **File I/O operations** in DevOps is crucial for automating tasks such as log management, configuration handling, backup operations, system monitoring, and more. Below is a step-by-step guide and examples of typical DevOps tasks that involve **efficient file handling**, along with Python scripts to help you master file I/O operations for DevOps.

---

### **1. Log File Monitoring and Parsing**

**Task**: Continuously monitor log files (e.g., application logs) for errors or warnings and take appropriate actions (e.g., triggering an alert or sending a notification).

#### **Steps**:
1. **Read log files line by line** to avoid loading the entire file into memory.
2. **Parse logs** to search for keywords (e.g., "ERROR" or "WARNING").
3. **Trigger actions** based on log content (e.g., send email or Slack notifications).

#### **Python Example**:
```python
import time
import re

# Function to process logs and trigger alerts
def process_log(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Read the file from the end to simulate tailing logs
        file.seek(0, 2)  # Move to end of the file
        while True:
            line = file.readline()
            if line:
                if re.search(r'ERROR|WARNING', line):  # Check for errors or warnings
                    print(f"ALERT: Found issue - {line.strip()}")
                    # Here you can add code to send notifications (email, Slack, etc.)
            else:
                time.sleep(1)  # Wait before checking for new logs

# Call function to monitor logs
process_log('/var/log/my_app.log')
```

#### **Key Concepts**:
- **`file.seek(0, 2)`**: Moves the file pointer to the end of the file.
- **`readline()`**: Reads one line at a time.
- **`re.search()`**: Searches for specific patterns in the logs (e.g., error or warning messages).

### **2. Configuration File Management**

**Task**: Manage configuration files (e.g., YAML, JSON, INI) for various applications and environments. You may need to read, update, or generate these configuration files as part of an automated deployment.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Read configuration files** to load application settings.
2. **Modify configurations** as needed (e.g., updating IP addresses, ports, or environment variables).
3. **Write back to configuration files** to save the updated settings.

#### **Python Example**:
```python
import json

# Reading and updating a JSON configuration file
def update_config(file_path, key, value):
    try:
        # Read the existing configuration
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            config = json.load(file)
        
        # Update the configuration
        config[key] = value
        
        # Write back the updated configuration
        with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
            json.dump(config, file, indent=4)
        print(f"Configuration updated: {key} = {value}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error updating config: {e}")

# Update the configuration
update_config('config.json', 'api_url', 'https://new-api-url.com')
```

#### **Key Concepts**:
- **`json.load()`**: Loads the JSON data from the file into a Python dictionary.
- **`json.dump()`**: Writes the updated dictionary back to the file in JSON format.

### **3. Backup Management (Creating and Restoring Backups)**

**Task**: Automate backups of important files, databases, or system states, and restore them when needed.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Create a backup** of a file or directory using compression (e.g., `tar` or `zip`).
2. **Store the backup** in a safe location (e.g., backup directory or cloud storage).
3. **Restore the backup** when necessary.

#### **Python Example**:
```python
import shutil
import os

# Function to create a backup of a directory
def create_backup(source_dir, backup_dir):
    if not os.path.exists(backup_dir):
        os.makedirs(backup_dir)
    
    # Use shutil to create a backup (tar the directory)
    backup_name = os.path.join(backup_dir, f"backup_{source_dir}.tar.gz")
    shutil.make_archive(backup_name.replace('.tar.gz', ''), 'gztar', source_dir)
    print(f"Backup created: {backup_name}")

# Function to restore a backup
def restore_backup(backup_file, restore_dir):
    if not os.path.exists(restore_dir):
        os.makedirs(restore_dir)
    
    shutil.unpack_archive(backup_file, restore_dir)
    print(f"Backup restored to: {restore_dir}")

# Create and restore backup
create_backup('/var/www/app', '/backups')
restore_backup('/backups/backup_var_www_app.tar.gz', '/var/www/app')
```

#### **Key Concepts**:
- **`shutil.make_archive()`**: Creates a compressed archive (backup).
- **`shutil.unpack_archive()`**: Extracts an archive to restore files.

### **4. Batch File Processing (Large Dataset Handling)**

**Task**: Process large datasets in batches (e.g., reading log files, processing large CSV/JSON files), especially when files exceed memory limits.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Read files in chunks** to avoid memory overload.
2. **Process each chunk** of data independently.
3. **Write processed data** to an output file or database.

#### **Python Example**:
```python
import csv

# Function to process large CSV file in batches
def process_large_csv(input_file, batch_size=1000):
    with open(input_file, 'r') as file:
        csv_reader = csv.reader(file)
        batch = []
        for row in csv_reader:
            batch.append(row)
            if len(batch) >= batch_size:
                # Process the batch (e.g., store in DB, perform analysis)
                print(f"Processing batch of {len(batch)} records...")
                batch.clear()  # Clear batch after processing
        if batch:
            print(f"Processing remaining {len(batch)} records...")
            batch.clear()  # Process remaining records

# Process large CSV file
process_large_csv('large_data.csv')
```

#### **Key Concepts**:
- **Batch processing**: Read and process data in manageable chunks to avoid memory overflow.
- **`batch.clear()`**: Clear the batch after each processing cycle.

### **5. File Compression and Archiving**

**Task**: Automate compression of files for efficient storage and fast transfers (e.g., gzip, zip).

#### **Steps**:
1. **Compress files** (logs, data files) to save storage space.
2. **Decompress files** when needed for access.

#### **Python Example**:
```python
import gzip
import shutil

# Function to compress a file
def compress_file(input_file, output_file):
    with open(input_file, 'rb') as f_in:
        with gzip.open(output_file, 'wb') as f_out:
            shutil.copyfileobj(f_in, f_out)
    print(f"File compressed: {output_file}")

# Function to decompress a file
def decompress_file(input_file, output_file):
    with gzip.open(input_file, 'rb') as f_in:
        with open(output_file, 'wb') as f_out:
            shutil.copyfileobj(f_in, f_out)
    print(f"File decompressed: {output_file}")

# Compress and decompress files
compress_file('logfile.log', 'logfile.gz')
decompress_file('logfile.gz', 'logfile_decompressed.log')
```

#### **Key Concepts**:
- **`gzip.open()`**: Opens a file for gzip compression or decompression.
- **`shutil.copyfileobj()`**: Copies the file content from one object to another.

### **6. File Permission Management**

**Task**: Manage file permissions (e.g., setting read/write permissions for log files, config files).

#### **Steps**:
1. **Set file permissions** using Pythonâ€™s `os` or `stat` module.
2. **Ensure proper access rights** for specific users or services.

#### **Python Example**:
```python
import os

# Function to change file permissions
def change_permissions(file_path, mode):
    os.chmod(file_path, mode)
    print(f"Permissions changed for {file_path}")

# Change permissions (e.g., make a file readable and writable by the owner)
change_permissions('myfile.txt', 0o600)
```

#### **Key Concepts**:
- **`os.chmod()`**: Changes the file permissions based on the provided mode.
- **`0o600`**: Represents read and write permissions for the owner.

---

### **7. File Synchronization (Distributed Systems)**

**Task**: Synchronize files across multiple servers (e.g., for configuration management, log aggregation, etc.).

#### **Steps**:
1. **Sync files** between local and remote systems using `rsync` or `scp`.
2. **Automate synchronization** for regular updates (e.g., config files, logs).

#### **Python Example**:
```python
import os

# Function to sync files using rsync (assuming rsync is installed)
def sync_files(source, destination):
    os.system(f"rsync -avz {source} {destination}")
    print(f"Files synchronized from {source} to {destination}")

# Sync files from local to remote server
sync_files('/local/path', 'user@remote:/remote/path')
```

#### **Key Concepts**:
- **`rsync`**: A powerful file synchronization tool used to copy or synchronize files efficiently.
- **`os.system()`**: Executes the system command (in this case, `rsync`).
