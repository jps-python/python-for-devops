# Functional Programming Concepts

**Python supports functional programming concepts, such as:**

- `First-Class Functions`: Functions can be passed around like any other object.
- `Higher-Order Functions`: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them.
- `Map`, `Filter`, `Reduce`: Functions that allow you to process iterables functionally.
